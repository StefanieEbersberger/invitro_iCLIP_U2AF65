# Random Forest analysis:

## Compilation of input data

571 binding sites, 12656 features.

8 transcript features (transcript_features.csv)
120 PWM features evaluated downstream/upstream of binding site and at the extended binding site itself = 360 PWM features (pwm_features.csv)
4096 6-mers evaluated downstream/upstream of binding site and at the extended binding site itself = 12288 k-mer features (kmer_features.csv)

In total: 
571 cases (binding sites), 12656 features.
173 binding sites are down regulated invivo (z-score < â€”1)
151 binding sites are unregulated invivo (z-score > 1)

## Random Forest Processing Details

Computational settings:

R version 3.3.1
randomForest 4.6-12

Parameter setting in random Forest call:

sampsize = c(149,151)
ntree = 20000


4985 features are removed because there is no entry in current selection of peaks.
2003 k-mer features are removed because of correlation issues (features are merged if correlation > 0.85).
129 PWM features are removed because of correlation issues.

5539 features are kept for first round of Random Forest (Input_for_first_Random_Forest.csv)
The top 30% features (1846 features, ranked by decreasing accuracy) are taken for second round of Random Forest.

Feature importance for second round of Random Forest for the 1846 features can be found in Features_ranked_by_MeanDecreaseAccuracy
